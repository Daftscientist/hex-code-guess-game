# Hex Guesser

This project is a Hex Color Guesser game created for a class project. The objective of the game is to guess the randomly generated hex color code as accurately as possible.

## Features

- **Random Color Generation**: The game generates a random hex color code for the user to guess.
- **User Input**: Users can input their guess for the hex color code.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: The game calculates the accuracy of the user's guess compared to the random color.
- **Hints**: Users can get hints to help them guess the color more accurately.
- **Confetti Celebration**: When the user guesses the color correctly, a confetti animation is displayed.
- **Attempts Tracking**: The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.
- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset the game to start over with a new random color.
- **Modal Dialog**: A modal dialog displays the results of the user's guess, including accuracy and total attempts.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
